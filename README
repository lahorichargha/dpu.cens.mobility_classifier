A DPU for classifying raw accelerometer and wi-fi data points into mobility modes.

The resulting modes will be one of: error, still, walk, run, drive. Bike is currently unsupported.

This DPU is available as a Java library and a JEE war file.

The Java library comes with an example: org.openmhealth.dpu.mobilityclassifier.example.Example. To run the example:

  1. cd to the root of this project
  2. Build the library: 
          ant clean dist-jar
  3. Run the example:
          java -cp dist:lib/joda-time-2.1.jar:lib/json.org-2011-11-03.jar:lib/mobility-classifier-1.2.9.jar:build/classes org.openmhealth.dpu.mobilityclassifier.example.Example
  
The example takes JSON mobility points stored in example.json and processes them using ClassificationService. The ClassifiedPoints
are then output to System.out.
